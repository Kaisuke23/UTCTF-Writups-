So my thoughts on this first off is that i didn't get to finish 2 of the problems because i didn't get hashcat to work nor how john the ripper worked. in the future i will need to figrure that out. for now, these are the challenges i finished



| Cryptography    | Web                        | Forensics          | Reverse Engineering |
|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| [basics] Crypto | Habby Dabby's Secret Stash | [basics] Forensics | [basics] re         |
|                 |                            | Low Sodium Bagel   |                     |

For the next time, i need to actually write things down and look at how long i have to do this. doing this in the first two hours and then leaving it is kind of a bad habit. but at least i made 161st LOL out of 581 teams, top 27% HAHAHA but i still have a lot to learn!
